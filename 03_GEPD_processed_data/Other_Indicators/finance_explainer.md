To calculate the government expenditure per school-age person in primary education as a percentage of GDP per capita, we followed these steps:

1. **Primary Education Expenditure**: The government expenditure on primary education was NGN 12,396,000,000, as reported on the [Edo State Public Finance Database](https://www.publicfinance.ngf.org.ng/nigeria-state-budget/edo-state-public-finance-database/).

2. **GDP per Capita**: We calculated the GDP per capita using the total GDP and the population. The total GDP was NGN 2,342,757,933,154.84, and the population was 3,233,366. This resulted in a GDP per capita of:

   GDP per capita = Total GDP / Population
   GDP per capita = 2,342,757,933,154.84 / 3,233,366 ≈ 724,557 NGN

3. **Out of School Rate**: According to the UIS data, the out-of-school rate for primary education was 25.63%. This means 25.63% of the primary school-age population is not enrolled in school.

4. **Student Population**: The student population enrolled in primary education was 282,370.

5. **Total School Age Population for Primary**: To find the total school-age population for primary education, we adjusted the student population by the out-of-school rate:

   Total school-age population = Student population / (1 - Out of school rate)
   Total school-age population = 282,370 / (1 - 0.2563) ≈ 379,683

6. **Expenditure per School Age Person**: We then calculated the expenditure per school-age person by dividing the total primary education expenditure by the total school-age population:

   Expenditure per school-age person = Total expenditure on primary / Total school-age population
   Expenditure per school-age person = 12,396,000,000 / 379,683 ≈ 32,655 NGN

7. **Expenditure as a Percentage of GDP per Capita**: Finally, we expressed this expenditure per school-age person as a percentage of GDP per capita:

   Expenditure as a percentage of GDP per capita = (32,655 / 724,557) * 100 ≈ 4.5%

Therefore, the government expenditure per school-age person in primary education is approximately 4.5% of the GDP per capita.
